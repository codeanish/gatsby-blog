## Lesson 1
- Install NodeJS
- Install Gatsby
- Hello Gatsby

```gatsby new app https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world```

The relevent files/folders in the project directory are:

```
app
|   gatsby-config.js
|   package-lock.json
|   package.json
|---src
|   |---pages
|   |   |   index.js
```

Components in the pages directory must be react 'components' and will automatically generate URL's mapped to the file name e.g. src/pages/index.js becomes mysite.com and src/pages/contact.js becomes mysite.com/contact.

gatsby-config.js is a very important file in Gatsby. It defines your sites metadata, plugins and other configuration. We'll be adding to this file as we build up the website.

package.json and the corresponding package-lock.json are responsible for defining dependencies and packages that have been installed in the workspace.
